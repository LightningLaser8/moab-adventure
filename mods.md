## Mods
MOAB Adventure supports a large range of dynamic user-added content, implemented through [Integrate](https://github.com/integrate-ml/integrate) mods.  
Managing mods can be done in-game, through the blue `Mods` button on the start menu.  

The game has a built-in mod browser, which gets mod repositories from GitHub.  
### Adding your mod to the browser
There is an example mod available [here]().
To make your mods discoverable, upload them to a GitHub repository.  
Add the topics `moab-adventure` and `mod`, and the mod should appear in the browser when players search.
